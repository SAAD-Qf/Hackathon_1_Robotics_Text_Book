The field of physical humanoid robotics focuses on the design, control, and application of robots that resemble and interact with the human world. These robots are engineered to mimic human morphology and behavior, enabling them to perform complex tasks in environments designed for humans. Key areas of study include bipedal locomotion, manipulation of objects with dexterous hands, human-robot interaction, and the development of advanced sensing and actuation systems. The ultimate goal is to create robots that can safely and effectively collaborate with or assist humans in a variety of settings, from industrial automation to personal care and exploration.
