# Basics of Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the world of **Humanoid Robotics**! In this chapter, we explore robots that **mimic human form and behavior**, and learn how AI enables them to perceive, plan, and act in real-world environments.

## What is a Humanoid Robot?

A humanoid robot is designed to resemble the human body. It typically has:
- Head, torso, arms, and legs
- Sensors for vision, balance, and touch
- Actuators for movement and manipulation

These robots are crucial for research, healthcare, education, and service industries.

## Key Components

1. **Sensors**  
   - LIDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, force sensors  
   - Allow the robot to perceive its environment and self-motion

2. **Actuators**  
   - Motors and servos that enable movement  
   - Enable walking, grasping, and object manipulation

3. **Controllers**  
   - Software that converts AI decisions into motor commands  
   - Manages balance, locomotion, and task execution

4. **Power Systems**  
   - Batteries or external power sources  
   - Energy management is critical for autonomous operation

## Why Humanoids Matter

Humanoid robots can:
- Navigate human-centric environments
- Perform tasks designed for humans
- Serve as research platforms for AI and robotics
- Assist humans in daily life or hazardous environments

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the structure and design of humanoid robots
- Identify key sensors and actuators
- Understand control and power requirements
- Describe real-world applications of humanoid robotics

## Practical Lab Exercise

**Objective:** Explore a humanoid robot's basic movements.

**Steps:**
1. Power up a small humanoid robot (e.g., Hiwonder TonyPi or Unitree Go2).  
2. Observe its default posture and joint positions.  
3. Write a Python script to move the robot’s arm or leg using its API.  
4. Execute the script and watch the robot perform the action.  

**Expected Output:**  
- The robot moves according to the script.  
- Understanding of joints, actuators, and robot posture is gained.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Robot does not move:** Check power supply and connections.  
2. **Script error:** Verify API calls and joint naming conventions.  
3. **Unstable posture:** Check balance algorithm and sensor calibration.
